### Commits <a name="commit"><a/>
Commiting is an essential part in every part of coding while connected to github, it makes sure you have the latest edited version of your code local on your computer, we got the code local to the computer in [Cloning](#clone). In a github file it is a green rectangular button at the bottom of the file that says commit changes, when commiting directly from github it strictly gives the code to github, you will not have the code local yet. To make your code local you will need to [Pull](#pull) in your code app, most likely android studio. In android studio, the commit button is a check mark in your top right corner. You are also allowed to commit and push, to be explained later in [pull](#pull).
